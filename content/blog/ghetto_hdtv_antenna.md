Summary: How I managed to watch the Olympics in HD without cable and Internet

This is just a quick and out of topic post compared to what I generally try to do. I noticed I was neglecting this blog a bit lately. I have been quite busy since the beginning of the year, moving from Montreal to San Francisco to work at a wonderful company.

We just moved into a new apartment and I decided we wouldn't get cable TV service, relying on the Internet and Netflix instead. However, we don't yet have the Internet service from [Sonic.net](http://sonic.net/). I recently ordered the much recommended [Mohu Leaf](http://store.gomohu.com/the-leaf-indoor-hdtv-antenna.html) but am still waiting for it to come, so we we're stuck watching old movies on the desktop.

...until I tried to hack a really ghetto TV antenna...

The steps are pretty simple. I just hope I had taken step by step picture (another time maybe) since I myself haven't found any good how to online before trying it.

* Find a coaxial cable (fortunately for me, the previous tenant left one in the apartment)
* Cut off one of the end with pliers
* Strip everything up to the middle copper cable for about 1-2 inches
* Wrap the copper part around a metal coat hanger
* Hang up somewhere
* Enjoy the Olympic snowboard in HD

Here's the result...
